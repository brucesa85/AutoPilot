# AutoPilot
AutoPilot scripts
When the VM is created using the "-CopyAutoPilotFiles" Switch you'll have the "Auto-Info.cmd" file copied to the System32 folder. Once the VM is in the OOBE screen press F8 and run "Auto-Info.cmd". You will be prompted for your azure credentials and the Hardware Hash will be uploaded to your Azure Windows Autopilot devices and also enroll it.
